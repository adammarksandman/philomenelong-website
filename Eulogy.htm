  <h1>Eulogy for Philomene Long</h1>
  <h2>October 2007</h2>
  <p>Councilman Rosendahl and friends of Venice,</p>
  <p>I am honored to have been asked to write tonight about my  mother, Philomene Long and her love for Venice.  Since her death, I have received tributes from the City Council, and cards,  poems and flowers from many in the Venice  community.  I am moved that my mother was  so appreciated by the community which she loved. Please accept this letter as  my gratitude for your kind thoughts during this difficult time. </p>
  <p>My mother LOVED Venice.  She might have been Queen of Bohemia but she  did not wander far from her throne. For nearly 40 years, we lived as a family  within 4 blocks in Venice--from  Park Ave  (where we lived twice) to Paloma    Ave (where we lived three times) with residences  on Sunset Ave and the Boardwalk in between. </p>
  <p>During that time, we lived with the Beats, with the Hippies,  with the 70s disco rollerskaters in mini shorts. We lived in Venice when the Canals were the place to  score. We lived through the 80s real estate boom (barely) and the 90s influx of  celebrities. Mom lived across from Eric Clapton for awhile with a prime view  into his living room. Stories to tell indeed…</p>
  <p>Throughout it all, my mother had her daily sunset walks by  the ocean. On one of these walks, she remarked to me that despite all the  changes Venice  had experienced, its skyline had changed little. Although some of the  characters had changed, Venice  still had its characters. We would laugh that we hadn’t changed much (or at  least my mother’s attire—dressed all in black or all in white with large  sunglasses and hat).</p>
  <p>I once offered my mother the opportunity to come live with  me in Washington, D.C. when she retired. We had a few good  laughs envisioning her leading the revolution walking the National Mall in full  Queen of Bohemia regalia. “I would never live there while that MAN is in the  White House”, she said, “Although I might reconsider if I could be buried next  to Jackie O.” I replied that unfortunately that place is taken by JFK. </p>
  <p>My mother could never leave Venice. It was thus fitting that she died in  her studio that overlooked the Boardwalk and the Ocean. She was found just a few  feet from her writing table, in the position that she slept in with her left  arm extended, her head tucked in, and wearing a shirt that said, “Between Life  and Death is Art”. </p>
  <p>Death in Venice  of its Poet Laureate </p>
  <p>But like her poem carved in the poetry wall at the Venice  Pavillion, her spirit emerges from pavement cracks in Venice, Holy Ground, stained by the blood of  poets. </p>
  <p>Thank you, Venice</p>
  <p>With deep love,<br />
    Maureen Luna-Long</p>
