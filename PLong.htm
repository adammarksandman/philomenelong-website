        Beat legend Philomene Long was born in Greenwich Village and cut her   literary teeth listening to poets verbally sear the paint off the walls of their   private hells. Later, after escaping a five year sentence in a Los Angeles   convent, she migrated to Venice, California, wrote poems and was crowned &quot;Queen   Of Bohemia,&quot; ruling the poets, saints and mad ones, at the desperate edge of the   Pacific Ocean.</td>

        Author John Maynard, in his book<em> Venice West:</em> <em>The Beat   Generation In Southern California</em> describes Philomene as dark, mercurial and   very Irish. &quot;She was a regular feature of the Ocean Front in her tennis shoes,   black thrift-shop dresses, long, straight hair, alarm-clock pendent, and heavy   silver cross... still, somehow, considering herself a nun, she joined the   world...and still lives the old ethic and upholds the old dream of salvation   through creativity and counts poverty as a sign of grace.&quot; </td>

        For some, she and her husband John Thomas epitomize the bohemianism   for which Venice West was once celebrated... &quot;living amidst the dregs of   society, finding uncommon beauty even in the shabby, water stained apartment   that leaks from the ceiling, picking through life's dustbin, searching for   scraps of the sublime.&quot; (Ellen Krout-Hasegawa. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021125070536/http://www.laweekly.com/">L.A.   Weekly)</a><br />

        Philomene spends her days grappling with the Muse in her Venice   apartment, which overlooks the Pacific and gives poetry readings. Her close   community of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021125070536/http://http//members.aol.com/labeats/index.html/">Beat   poets</a> pconsists of John Thomas, Frank Rios, Tony Scibella, Aya and the late   Stuart Perkoff. Of these poets she has written: &quot;To Venice from the late 50's to   early 70's they had come, weary of deceit, consumed by the Muse and murderous   silences, their footsteps; silent lightning, pierced deep into the earth.   Venetians were here to devour fire and to be devoured.&quot;<br />
        Philomene Long is   both a poet and a film director. Martin Sheen reads her poems in her film &quot;The   California Missions&quot; which can be found at the Los Angeles Public Library as   well as universities and libraries throughout the United States. &quot;The Beats: An   Existential Comedy,&quot; features Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Shirley   Clarke, and Stuart Perkoff. It was screened in Italy at the 1996 Venice Biennale   Film Festival. It was screened again, in November 1997. Among her books of   poetry is <em>The Ghosts of Venice West</em>. In September, 1997, there was a book   signing party for her most recent work, <em>Bukowski in the Bathtub:   Recollections of Charles Bukowski with John Thomas </em>at Los Angeles' oldest   literary center, Beyond Baroque in Venice.<br /></td>
