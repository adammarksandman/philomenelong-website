  <h1>About Philomene Long</h1>
  <p style="margin-left:50px"><img src="Images/Philomene-Long_4.gif" alt="Philomene Long" /></p>
  <p>This website is dedicated to Philomene Long, a poet, teacher and filmmaker who was known alternately as the Poet   Laureate of Venice, CA and the 'Queen of Bohemia'.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Philomene was passionately committed to poetry,”   said Fred Dewey, director of Beyond Baroque, the Venice literary arts   center. “She understood it down to her old Irish roots.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>According to Dewey, Long wrote in the tradition of the Beat poets of the   1950s and ’60s but added phrases that suggest Zen koans and liturgical chants,   drawing from her personal interests and experience. Long, who spent about five   years as a Catholic nun in her 20s, was a Zen practitioner.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Many different streams fed her work,”   Dewey said.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>She wrote several volumes of poetry, including “The Queen of Bohemia” and   “The Ghosts of Venice West,” and also wrote “American Zen Bones, Maezumi Roshi   Stories,” a prose work about the founder of the Zen Center of Los Angeles. As a   film director, Long is best known for “The Beats: An Existential Comedy,” with   poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti making appearances. She also   directed “The California Missions,” narrated by Martin Sheen.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“She was not only a poet but a teacher and mentor   who carried forth the Beat poetry tradition,” said S.A.   Griffin, who included Long in “The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry,” an   anthology he co-edited in 1999.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>During her 16 years on the faculty of the writers’ program at UCLA’s extension school, Long taught courses on the   creative process and on poetry for non-poets, among others.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Philomene brought a deeply loving, positive quality   to her teaching,” said Linda Venis, director of the program. “Student   evaluations were extremely high.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Early in her literary career in the 1960s, Long befriended members of the   Beat Generation poets of Southern California, part of the larger movement led by   poets Jack Kerouac and Ginsberg.</p>
  <p>The group’s bohemian lifestyle was described in “Venice West, the Beat   Generation in Southern California” (1991) by historian John Arthur Maynard, who   referred to Long as “mercurial” with a memorable sense of style. She was “a   regular feature of the Ocean Front in her tennis shoes, black thrift-shop   dresses, long, straight hair, alarm-clock pendant and heavy silver cross,”   Maynard wrote.</p>
  <p>Her adopted city inspired many of Long’s poems. One of them is written on a   “poet’s wall” near the boardwalk. It reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Venice,<br />
      Holy Ground<br />
      Stained with the blood of poets<br />
      City which lies<br />
      Beneath the breasts of birds<br />
      Guarded by cats<br />
      Behind every corner<br />
      The Muse, Angel of Surprise<br />
      Poems out of pavement cracks.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The daughter of a naval officer, Long was born Aug. 17, 1940, in New York   City. She moved with her family to San Diego as a teenager.</p>
  <p>She graduated from the Academy of Our Lady of Peace high school in San Diego   and Mount St. Mary’s College in Los Angeles. She also earned a master of fine   arts degree at UCLA.</p>
  <p>After her early plan to become a nun, she discovered that she wanted to be a   poet and moved to Venice. In recent years Long upheld the community’s reputation   as a haven for artists, often opening her small apartment near the beach to   gatherings of writers, musicians and artists.</p>
  <p>“Philomene was deeply committed to the bohemian   lifestyle, a life outside the normal groupings of society,” Dewey said.</p>
  <p>Philomene Long was married twice, and her survivors include her children, Maureen   Luna-Long and Patrick Moore, sister Pegarty Long, and grandchildren, Aidan and Tara Sandman-Long.</p>
  <p>Her daughter, Maureen Luna-Long gave the following Eulogy in October 2007: <a href="Eulogy.htm">Eulogy for Philomene Long</a>.</p>
