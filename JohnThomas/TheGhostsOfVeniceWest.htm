  <h1>The Ghosts of Venice West (1994)</h1>

  <h2>COLD ELLISON I</h2>
  <p><em>&quot;Cold cliffs more  beautiful</em> <br />
    <em>The deeper you enter</em> <br />
    <em>Yet no one travels this  road.&quot;</em> <br />
-Han Shan,<em> Cold Mountain</em><br />
                <br />
                <br />
In  this old cold Venice  building<br />
“The  Ellison”<br />
In  this small dark room<br />
I  sit cross-legged<br />
Upon  an old stale mattress<br />
The  feathers are finally<br />
Leaving  my pillow<br />
To  rejoin the birds of the air</p>
  <p>At  least once a month<br />
    The  upstairs neighbor's toilet overflows<br />
    Our  ceiling bulges<br />
    The  walls turn black and green</p>
  <p>In  this dripping room<br />
    All  my clothes are torn<br />
    Our  only guests<br />
    The  ghosts, the mice<br />
    Only  dust<br />
    Over  dog eared books<br />
    And  drifts of paper<br />
    Like  dirty snow<br />
    My  daughter stays away, says<br />
  &quot;You  were never a model<br />
    For  a nine to five job.&quot;<br />
    My  son visits occasionally<br />
    Long  enough to smile<br />
    And  ask for an aspirin</p>
  <p>In  this cold room<br />
    The  window is bricked up<br />
    The  pipes leak<br />
    Puddles  always on the kitchen floor<br />
    Never  any rice in the pot<br />
    Once  there was a view<br />
    A  eucalyptus tree, a ghost gum <br />
    It  was cut down in June<br />
    <br />
    I,  who once was proud<br />
    That  they called me<br />
  &quot;The  Queen of Bohemia&quot;<br />
    Now  blush, ashamed<br />
  &quot;John!&quot;  I call<br />
  &quot;I'm  trying to bring myself<br />
    Out  of something -<br />
    To  nothing...<br />
    I'm  going to pray<br />
    To <em>embrace</em> this poverty!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Pray  to embrace <em>silence</em><br />
    We  already have poverty!&quot; he says<br />
  &quot;Hey.  We're doing pretty well<br />
    For  a tired old man<br />
    And  a crazy lady...<br />
    Tomorrow  I'll get you <br />
    A  crown of rhinestones.<br />
    Do  I give you enough?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;John,  to have you <br />
    For  my companion<br />
    Through  the glass centuries<br />
    Your  diamond body<br />
    Calm,  enormous land <br />
    This  is the only center<br />
    That  I seek.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  night<br />
    The  cockroaches come out<br />
    They  walk across my neck<br />
    To  get to Masami Teraoka's print<br />
  &quot;Zen  Monk On A Blue Whale&quot;<br />
    Hakuin  contemplates death<br />
    They  take refuge in the Buddha<br />
    Little  insect eyes. Sad. Sad.<br />
    But  too many.  A thousand at least<br />
    So  they must die<br />
    We'll  use the money from <br />
    Selling  our books of poems<br />
    To  purchase roach poison<br />
    <br />
    There  are no roads<br />
    From  this cold Ellison <br />
    Better  sit still<br />
    And  quiet the ills<br />
    Of  the mind</p>
  <p>I  sit high in this old building<br />
    Higher  yet the sky passes slowly<br />
    The  birds swirl<br />
    Incautious,  completely free<br />
    I  climb the road<br />
    To  cold, cold Ellison<br />
    The  road that never ends<br />
  &quot;Who  can break the snares of the world<br />
    And  sit with me<br />
    Among the white clouds?&quot;</p>
  <p>-- Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON II<br />
  </h2>
  <p>Two  and a half years<br />
(On  and off)<br />
Earthquake  proofing<br />
The  Ellison<br />
Steel  blades of <br />
Buzz  saws on steel I-beams<br />
Pounding  of<br />
Hammer  on brick<br />
Hammer  on brick<br />
Between  the shouts<br />
Rage,  rage<br />
Between  the shouts<br />
Of  addicts and prostitutes<br />
Rage,  rage</p>
  <p>It  is impossible to move<br />
    For  midst the sand and dust my love<br />
    John  Thomas is the caliph of Baghdad<br />
    The  man who refused to travel<br />
    Because  it would require four hundred<br />
    Camels  to take his bedside books</p>
  <p>All  day I dream of being a hostage in Iran<br />
    Dim  basement<br />
    Empty  walls<br />
    Rent  free<br />
    Food  brought to me<br />
    Three  times a day<br />
    Quiet<br />
    Only  the muffled<br />
    Prayers  to Allah<br />
    In  the next room<br />
    Occasionally  they whip<br />
    The  souls of my feet<br />
    That's  all right<br />
    It  keeps me awake<br />
    Which  is more silent than dreams</p>
  <p>There  in Iran<br />
    I  would sit cross-legged<br />
    Until  my legs happily<br />
    Fell  off<br />
    My  only request <br />
    A  blindfold<br />
    And  ear plugs<br />
    I  would sit<br />
    And  not even think<br />
    Of  Bodhidharma staring at that wall for nine years<br />
    He's  too loud</p>
  <p>-- Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON III</h2>
  <p><em>&quot;I used to be  fairly poor, as poor goes</em>.<br />
    <em>Today I hit the bottom  of poverty and cold</em>.<br />
    <em>Nothing I do seems to  come out right</em>.<br />
    <em>Wherever I go I get  pushed around.&quot;</em> </p>
  <p>                 <u>Cold</u><u> Mountain</u> -Han Shan</p>
  <p>This month<br />
    The Cold Ellison<br />
    Brought us the Asian Flu<br />
    Too much noise<br />
    Too little sleep<br />
    Then blasts of cement dust<br />
    Last night I coughed for fourteen hours<br />
    This building is going to kill me<br />
    <br />
    John coughs from across the musty room<br />
    He'll claim: &quot;It is the force behind the  heavens&quot;</p>
  <p>AH! Great statue of the reclining  Buddha!<br />
    John Thomas, everyday<br />
    Stretched across the bed<br />
    Leaning on his left elbow<br />
    Writes glowing poems<br />
    Among his pillows<br />
    Of books and dust</p>
  <p>There is not enough dust<br />
    In this poem</p>
  <p>Another cough from across the room<br />
    Then John hums<br />
  &quot;Om mane  padme<br />
    Ho humm...<br />
    All the bodhisattvas<br />
    Are rolling over <br />
    Slapping each other<br />
    Over that one<br />
    In compassionate mirth!”</p>
  <p>Last month <br />
    Our ninety-year-old neighbor said<br />
    This place depressed her<br />
  &quot;Too dark, too dark,&quot; she said<br />
  &quot;Philomene, You deserve<br />
    Better than this.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The year's end has left me<br />
    Ragged and desolate</p>
  <p>With this dust:<br />
    My eyes, black circles<br />
    I can no longer read, even short poems<br />
    Must sit alone in the dark<br />
    Hour after hour<br />
    <br />
    Poetry and religion brought me here</p>
  <p>Through this cold Ellison<br />
    I journey to the very center</p>
  <p>-- Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON IV</h2>
  <p>&quot;Living in the mountains, <br />
    mind ill at ease,  <br />
    All I do is grieve at  <br />
    the passing years.<br />
  At great labor I gathered<br />
  the herbs of long life;<br />
  But has all my striving<br />
  made me an immortal?&quot;<br />
  Cold   Mountain<br />
  -- Han Shan</p>
  <p><br />
    Thank you for pretending
    <br />
    To be here
    <br />
    I do not know but
    <br />
    Have I brought you?
    <br />
    The words must have done that
    <br />
    The silence needs neither
    <br />
    You nor me
    <br />
    It is so deeply
    <br />
    Unreasonable
    <br />
    Even the mice have
    <br />
    Left me, and
    <br />
    My dear departed fly
    <br />
    <br />
    To have died
    <br />
    And still the living are
    <br />
    Unwilling
    <br />
    To release me
    <br />
    I sit
    <br />
    Crosslegged my
    <br />
    Broken, bleeding feet
    <br />
    Once I could have had
    <br />
    Much to say
    <br />
    About them
    <br />
    Left palm upon my right
    <br />
    Thumbs touch at the tips
    <br />
    Is this my hand?  Or a 
    <br />
    Cloud?  I hear my own
    <br />
    Weeping in
    <br />
    The distance
    <br />
    Their laughter
    <br />
    Over my grave
    <br />
    <br />
    My hair was once
    <br />
    A brilliant red
    <br />
    Or yellow?  Everyone said so
    <br />
    My eyes, I think, were green
    <br />
    The sand has scraped
    <br />
    The color from them
    <br />
    Eyes now white
    <br />
    Hair white
    <br />
    So much hair, and
    <br />
    Each strand causes me pain
    <br />
    <br />
    Am I here then?
    <br />
    I can scarcely hear
    <br />
    My own words
    <br />
    Or yours
    <br />
    This endless yawn and gape of sand
    <br />
    Exhausts me
    <br />
    Once I had hoped
    <br />
    (Was this vanity?)
    <br />
    For my death
    <br />
    To be worthwhile, not
    <br />
    To become simply sand
    <br />
    More sand
    <br />
    <br />
    Thank you for pretending
    <br />
    To be here</p>
  <p>-- Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON V<br />
    </h2>
  <p>Warm summery days        At the Ellison <br />
  And &quot;Bones&quot; the young dog Chris found        I the last stages of starvation
  <br />
  Infected with heartworms        Damaged eye from being kicked
  <br />
  Back full of gun pellets        And Chris had to carry him everywhere
  <br />
  Slung across his shoulders like a mink stole        It was beginning to seem that
  <br />
  He was deciding he would spend        The rest of his life on Chris' shoulders.
  <br />
  &quot;Bones&quot; is fat now, and trots                                       
  <br />
  Fat lazy days at the Ellison        And the building is finally earthquake proof
  <br />
  So that with the 7.5 sent from Joshua Tree        And the 3,000 aftershocks
  <br />
  It moved with such grace        Cruised the shocks, the ripples
  <br />
  Like an elegant ship        And it still moves
  <br />
  To the music in Paul and Barb's apartment
  <br />
  And for my son Patrick         (My beautiful son)
  <br />
  And the Blue Crew surfers, these days        The waves are good
  <br />
  At night I walk down to the sea        And in the very place
  <br />
  They ride their boards        Dolphins leap and roll and ride
  <br />
  The waves in themselves        The very spot
  <br />
  Must be a good one        Warm summer waves
  <br />
  Soft swaying days
  <br />
  At the Ellison        Its marshmallow bricks
  <br />
  The lazy elevator         And my daughter Maureen returns
  <br />
  From Asia (my beautiful daughter)        She brings me a gift
  <br />
  Of a Buddhist   Temple bell        The bell she gives me
  <br />
  Brings three dreams --
  <br />
  I dream I am a Buddhist monk        And that I have been given
  <br />
  A small Zendo        The size of our apartment
  <br />
  I dream I enter a deep dark cave        Where there are Giant Living Buddhas
  <br />
  I dream I am a
  <br />
  Buddhist monk basketball team        But they have to stop the game
  <br />
  Because we are jumping too high                           
  <br />
  &quot;Now that's a the <u>real</u> dream team&quot;        My daughter days
  <br />
  Soft summer days
  <br />
  At the Ellison        John whispers
  <br />
  Across the room
  <br />
  &quot;You and I, Philomene, that's        All that matters --
  <br />
  You and I&quot;
  <br />
  &quot;You and I, John and        The radiant, the vast...&quot;
  <br />
  &quot;Apartment&quot;, he says
  <br />
  Soft, dreaming days
  <br />
  The Ellison dreaming, swaying        Dipping and sailing
  <br />
  Its own warm seas  </p>
  <p>--Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON VI</h2>
  <p><em>&quot;As for me, I delight in the everyday way,</em> <br />
    <em>Amidst wrapped vines and rocky caves.</em> <br />
    <em>Here in the wilderness I am completely free.&quot;</em> <br />
                                 Han Shan<em>,  Cold Mountain</em><br />
  </p>
  <p>Silver days at the  Ellison<br />
    Longest rainstorm in ten  years<br />
    Beneath the slippery sky<br />
    The Ellison glistening          <br />
    Dangling raindrops<br />
    Silver sounds</p>
  <p>Sunset<br />
    I slip out to the sea<br />
    I am the only person<br />
    On Venice beach<br />
    Grey sea, grey sky, grey  sea gulls<br />
    I am wearing a bright  pink raincoat<br />
    The seagulls believe I  am the sunset<br />
    They turn their backs to  the sea and face me<br />
    They assume their sunset  viewing positions<br />
    Chests forward<br />
    Motionless. Except for<br />
    An occasional scratch of  the ear<br />
    The flutter of a wing</p>
  <p>We watch each other<br />
    I act like the sunset  for them<br />
    I raise my glowing pink  arms<br />
    I stand motionless for a  long time<br />
    Kneel, then recline upon  my heels<br />
    Alone on Venice Beach<br />
    It is all so slow, so  simple<br />
    Being a sunset</p>
  <p>Back at the Ellison.<br />
    Alone at the black iron  gate<br />
    I look up<br />
    Soft rain sliding<br />
    Over the red bricks<br />
    Two red brick wings open <br />
    As if to embrace me<br />
    Two ghostly shimmering  red wings</p>
  <p>We watch each other<br />
    I look at the Ellison<br />
    As the sea gulls looked  at me<br />
    I love this old  building!<br />
    I love this old  building!</p>
  <p>Ah! yes, Kukai, the  gulls and<br />
    Yes! Even these stones<br />
    Will become Buddhas</p>
  <p>--Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>COLD ELLISON VII</h2>
  <p>This is a dynamic account of        Blinking and breathing<br />
    <br />
  At day the pigeons outside the window        Eye our apartment with envy
    <br />
  At night I haunt the Ellison        In long white gowns, white veils
  <br />
  At dawn, more pigeons        Then arriving gloriously with the sun
  <br />
  Flies from a living mobile        In the center of our room
  <br />
  Photographs of dead saints surround us
  <br />
  On the wall, a large wooden crucifix        Holy water, oils and two white candles
  <br />
  Within it. Portable for the rite of the dying         It is the last thing I see each night
  <br />
  Before I go to sleep
  <br />
  The landlord is running from        The law. On sight they can
  <br />
  Arrest him for what he's done        To this building.
  <br />
  John calls him a devil        &quot;What this building needs,&quot; he says <br />
&quot;Is an Exorcist.&quot;        Never before have I had the law <br />
  On my side, not even        The Ten Commandments
  <br />
  Last night Harry Northup
  <br />
  Kindly found us someone        Who would clean our apartment
  <br />
  For only twenty-five dollars        But I didn't have the heart
  <br />
  To tell him we won't        Have that kind of money
  <br />
  For six months
  <br />
  Last night Holly Prado told us        &quot;That you love each other, <br />
  That you live in this tiny apartment        Is a miracle.&quot;
  <br />
  This morning another spiral of flies        The pigeons blink and breathe
  <br />
  It is good that I hung
  <br />
  That picture in the kitchen        Where they bricked up the window --
  <br />
  The woman with long auburn hair and crown        Ascending, chains breaking from her wrists
  <br />
  Angels circling. It reminds me of my future--        To be crowned in Heaven. That I was once
  <br />
  Crowned there already, that...
  <br />
&quot;John,&quot; I shout from across the room        &quot;You said you would get <br />
My Queendom back for me!&quot;        &quot;I have,&quot; he says <br />
&quot;What do you call <u>this</u>!&quot;
  <br />
&quot;Queen of Bohemia!         Now Queen of Leaks! <br />
  Queen of Pigeons!          Queen of these catacombs!
  <br />
  John, you're making me feel        Like this squalor is better than Heaven!&quot;
  <br />
&quot;It took you eight years to         Realize that!&quot;  he says <br />
  The pigeons have mastered their envy
  <br />
  And settled for our windowsill        Their orange eyes radiantly blinking
  <br />
  Golden crown        Celestial pigeons</p>

  <h2>COLD ELLISON VIII</h2>
  <p>It seems to me, Philomene,  your apartment is<br />
a little bit of  hyperrealism.  -- Mario Savio, 1974</p>
  <p>Dust particles clinging to the hint of reality<br />
    is this what we are?     – Hammond  Guthrie, 2004</p>
  <p>In these rooms, it seems to me<br />
    The dust speaks<br />
    Dust mostly from books<br />
    (The dominant presence of<br />
    These rooms, my enclosure)</p>
  <p>At times a book will fall<br />
    (Perhaps under pressure<br />
    Of too much dust)<br />
    And open to a sentence by Sappho:<br />
    “The sounds of mourning<br />
    Do not suit a house<br />
    Which serves the Muse;<br />
    They are not wanted here”</p>
  <p>“Mom,” my son Patrick says:<br />
    “You feel that gravity will cease to exist<br />
    If I move a speck of dust.”</p>
  <p>Daily, hourly he says that I ask him:<br />
    “Where am I? What happened? <br />
    What is that dull sound?<br />
    The future of the universe being ripped apart?”</p>
  <p>I have not always been emotional<br />
    About dust, but so much of this particular<br />
    Dust is my late husband<br />
    John Thomas’ dust<br />
    I love this<br />
    Dust</p>
  <p>“Where are my dead leaves, Patrick?”<br />

    “They are with the other dead leaves”</p>
  <p>There was a caterpillar in the bathroom<br />
    Living amidst the dust of a dead rose<br />
    It looked like it was going to run out of food so<br />
    He moved it to kitchen plants, but<br />
    It slid out the window when<br />
    The pigeons were being fed and<br />
    I think a pigeon may have gotten it</p>
  <p>Patrick is here to organize<br />
    After John became (shall I say?)<br />
    More subtle than dust</p>
  <p>Patrick: “MOM!<br />
    Why must everything you say<br />
    Sound like a poem?! <br />
    A moment ago you said <br />
    ‘The wind! The wind!<br />
    It seems as if it is going<br />
    To scrape Venice  off the Pacific plate!!’<br />
    Instead of the normal:<br />
    ‘It’s a little windy today’ ”</p>
  <p>Patrick is in the closet now<br />
    “Mom! You cannot wear that!<br />
    It looks like you took it off a dead body<br />
    It looks like what Norman Bates’ mother<br />
    Would wear sitting in a chair!”</p>
  <p>He finishes with the black velvet section<br />
    Now to the long white dresses<br />
    (I now wear little else--<br />
    The color of Light and Dust)</p>
  <p>“Wait!”<br />
    He shouts<br />
    “What did I just pass?<br />
    Is this for catching fish?”</p>
  <p>“That’s old lace”</p>
  <p>“If you wear this you should<br />
    Be sited for public nudity”<br />
    <br />
    “I wear a slip under it…<br />
    A white veil over my head…<br />
    I dress for the Muse… at times<br />
    Become the Muse… the<br />
    Bride of… Love Itself…”</p>
  <p>Patrick:<br />
    “You just keep having<br />
    Random thoughts as you<br />
    Lie on your back<br />
    Spouting them out loud<br />
    As I move stuff around”</p>
  <p>Random thoughts<br />
    That’s just the problem<br />
    Patrick’s organizing has been<br />
    Hard on my thought processes<br />
    It’s been snipping my synapses <br />
    So that I’ve begun referring<br />
    To this archeological dig<br />
    (So to speak) as “Organizen”  </p>
  <p>But  tonight I am told<br />
    By Kyoko Asanuma<br />
    (A Japanese Exchange student<br />
    In my UCLA class)<br />
    That the Japanese have no<br />
    Dominance of right brain or left brain <br />
    They use both simultaneously<br />
    And now I can’t stop singing:<br />
    “I think I’m turning Japanese<br />
    I think I’m turning Japanese<br />
    I think I’m turning Japanese<br />
    I really think so”</p>
  <p>“Patrrick,” I say<br />
    “I want the place to be<br />
    Part Zen monastery<br />
    Part literary salon”</p>
  <p>So he lovingly<br />
    Much like the Dalai Lama with <br />
    Tibetan Buddhist Sand Paintings)<br />
    Sweeps much of the dust away<br />
    Except for the pipes<br />
    I ask for the dust to be left on the pipes</p>
  <p>Dust which I have let fall gracefully<br />
    Over these last two years<br />
    And lay upon where<br />
    John’s lips have touched <br />
    Mingling breath with ash<br />
    His breath, our breath<br />
    19 years <br />
    Breathing together<br />
    Breathing together<br />
    Our breath, our life--<br />
    The Intersection of<br />
    Love and Poetry    <br />
    <br />
    “90% of dust is human debris”<br />
    John would say<br />
    I do not know if this is correct<br />
    But if it is-- much of this dust IS <br />
    John Thomas</p>
  <p>So I request dust be left<br />
    On the floor where<br />
    John’s bed had been<br />
    Dust over which I scatter tears<br />
    Then cover it with plastic<br />
    Where I create a small Zendo<br />
    The very spot where he and I<br />
    So often made love in the afternoon light<br />
    And I place</p>
  <p>A cushion on this very spot<br />
    Where he would recline<br />
    On his left elbow<br />
    Stretched out like a<br />
    Reclining Buddha<br />
    And read and write and<br />
    Fall half- awake / half-asleep<br />
    Into his ocean out of time<br />
    “Silence, I know, loves me”<br />
    He would say</p>
  <p>Dust, I know<br />
    Has always loved<br />
    John Thomas<br />
    He, always, so mountain-still<br />
    Could create dust</p>
  <p>I sit quietly<br />
    Breathing slowly<br />
    And sometimes<br />
    In the morning and afternoon light<br />
    I watch new dust</p>
  <p>Which the Pacific winds move <br />
    So very gracefully<br />
    Across these rooms<br />
    At times<br />
    Slowly, happily<br />
    I become<br />
    Like dust, myself</p>
  <p>As I listen to the loud<br />
    TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK<br />
    Of our very small<br />
    Black plastic clock<br />
    (Only 2” by 2” but<br />
    Sounds like a Grandfather’s Clock)<br />
    Sometimes the only sound<br />
    In these rooms<br />
    So that it seems as if</p>
  <p>It is the only sound<br />
    Everywhere, anywhere<br />
    The First Sound<br />
    Before the First Word<br />
    And before the first sound the<br />
    Silence which<br />
    “The sky can’t cover<br />
    The earth can’t support<br />
    Empty space can’t contain<br />
    Sun and moon can’t illuminate…”<br />
    And    </p>
  <p>Time<br />
    Drops<br />
    Off<br />
    Each<br />
    Tick<br />
  </p>
  <p>And our words<br />
    Now into dust<br />
    In these rooms words<br />
    So softly uttered<br />
    Almost unspoken<br />
    Dust now speaking<br />
    As if one person<br />
    Our poems now<br />
    So slow, so silent<br />
    That only he and I<br />
    Can hear</p>
  --Philomene Long, April, 2004<br />

  <h2>THERE IS NO COMFORT<br />
  </h2>
  <p>There is no comfort<br />
In the poem.<br />
Expect to be seared<br />
Out to have entry.</p>
  <p>There are always<br />
    The rains.<br />
    They leave no survivors.<br />
    The poem’s ocean is stone.</p>
  <p>Who knows<br />
    Whet god will be found in its ashes.</p>
  <p>There is a calm<br />
    In the power of its snows.<br />
    I speak for the dead.</p>
  <p>--Philomene Long</p>
  <h2>THE GHOSTS OF VENICE WEST</h2>
  <p>They are already ghosts<br />
John and Philomene<br />
As they   pass<br />
Along the Boardwalk<br />
Where ghosts and poets overlap<br />
As they pass,   the gulls<br />
Ghosting above their shadows</p>
  <p>Everything's haunting everything</p>
  <p>Already ghosts<br />
    John and Philomene<br />
    Under the ghostly   lampposts<br />
    Of Venice West<br />
    Their cadence<br />
    The breath of sleep<br />
    At   rest<br />
    Lost at the edge of America<br />
    Already ghosts<br />
    And each   poem<br />
    Already a farewell</p>
  <p>Everything's haunting everything<br />
    The sea is the ghost of   the world</p>
  <p>--Philomene Long</p>
