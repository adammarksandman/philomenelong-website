  <h2><strong><a name="Interview1" id="Interview1"></a>The Queen of Bohemia:</strong></h2>
  <p><em><strong> Interview   with Philomene Long<br />
    </strong>by Mary   Sands</em><br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      MS:</strong> Philomene, thanks for doing this interview. This issue of <em>Jack   Magazine's</em> Renaissance section looks at the Beat/Bohemian history of   literature and art in southern California. You've been a part of the Venice   Beats, and other Los Angeles-related Bohemia for a long time. I want to later   talk about two new books that you have out as well as what else you're doing   these days, but first I'm interested in the physical scene as it was out here in   southern California back when you first arrived here. Tell us about the colors,   the light. What were your first impressions--more so tactical ones than mood or   spiritual impressions? I read that you &quot;found beauty even in the shabby, water   stained apartment that leaks from the ceiling, picking through life's dustbin,   searching for scraps of sublime&quot; (<em>LA Weekly</em>: Krout-Hawegawa). Was your   introduction to Venice West totally an urban one, or did it go into the natural   surroundings?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Only   artists and criminals in those days. Venice West was a city of outsiders. It was   (and still is) a last stop-off at the edge of America. The Venice sky is   tactile. You can hold its light in your palms. Often pale yellow to golden,   depending on the time of day--and always the blue omnipresence of the sea. Ocean   and outlaws. Its setting is a perfect balance for poetry. Beauty and danger.   Agony and rapture.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> How have   these physical surroundings changed in the last 40+ years?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> It's not   as quiet. I suppose that 40+ years ago the criminals kept Venice quiet. And the   artists at work. People used to be afraid to come here. But back then people's   doors were open. Just walk in. Sit on the floor. Pads furnished out of the   alley. Clothes from Salvation Army. Everyone knew everyone. That's impossible   now. Seems the whole world passes beneath my window. 40+ years later the sky and   sea are much the same. The gulls do fine with or without us. The pelicans left   for a while, but they returned. There are more dolphins now and they seem to   leap higher. More dolphins, more humans, less cockroaches.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> According   to our guest editor Hammond Guthrie, the quality of the water in the Venice   canals putrefied shortly after their construction. An analogy of putrefied water   and development vs. the artsy scene just came to mind.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> May I   substitute the word &quot;artsy&quot; with artist? Interesting analogy. Are you thinking   that a pure artist's life requires a degree of the putrid? I've often pondered   that very question but have not yet answered it. But Hammond Guthrie is correct.   I once asked a canal resident what the ducks ate. He said he wasn't sure but   gave me a putrid list that included (I may be imagining this) the tips of the   tails of deceased mice. He added he that did know one thing: he wouldn't eat one   of those ducks!</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Out of   curiosity, did you ever know anyone from the family of the man who built the   canals?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Didn't   know the people. Just their houses. Abbot Kinney himself lived in the now   blue-painted house at the corner of Park Avenue and Speedway. Thornton Avenue   was named after one of his sons. Paloma Avenue was named, I believe, because of   the preposterous number of pigeons on this street.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Related   to the physical landscape question, what about the spiritual and inspirational   ones? What was it like to escape into a counterculture (from a convent, no less)   and find yourself amid likeminded people?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Likeminded people in search of beatitude. I not only descended from a convent   atop a mountain overlooking Los Angeles, I descended from an upper-middle-class   environment where I had been raised to be a lady. I have the royal gene. My   ancestors were Irish royalty. So, yes, it was entering another cloister, and a   self-imposed exile.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Did you   embrace Buddhism or another religion and throw out your &quot;old&quot; religion, hang   onto everything or nothing--what kinds of spirituality have inspired your   life?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Zen   Buddhism is my practice. But I do hang onto the heart of my &quot;old&quot; religion. The   pulse of the Beat Generation came from the heart of Catholicism: &quot;Be-at.&quot;   Kerouac first cracked it open with his vision that came from the Beatitudes. The   first Beatitude is: &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&quot; The last: &quot;Blessed are   you, when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of   evil against you falsely. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted   were the prophets that were before you.&quot; Jack Kerouac could identify with that   last one.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Do you   think that the same kind of avenues of expression and spirituality found in the   sixties is still around today--if not, what is different?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> There is   a silent Buddhist revolution in America today that began to spread with the Beat   Generation. Some of it is in a diluted form, some more penetrating: from the   World Champion Los Angeles Lakers whose coach is called &quot;the Zen master&quot; and has   his players practice Zen before playing basketball, to the Catholic Church's   resuscitation of its contemplative tradition, much with the use of Buddhist   practices.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> What   other artists were on the set at this time?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> John   Thomas, of course, and Stuart Perkoff, Tony Scibella, Frank Rios.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> I've read   much about Stuart Perkoff and your husband John Thomas.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> As for   Stuart Perkoff--Jack Foley, who has recently published <em>California Rebels,   Beats &amp; Radicals</em>, has asked me to describe my relationship with Stuart.   I believe it is for a new book he is writing that has a focus on Southern   California poets. Jack liked this sentence, so I'll give it to you:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The first landmark taken from us was   time.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Something took hold of Stuart and me and set us down   in the country of what he called from nowhere to nowhere. We were in some sense   mated. (Not as husband or wife. I would never be anybody's wife, never--until   John Thomas.) What Stuart and I were to become together as yet has no   name.</p>
  <p>Stuart Perkoff and John Thomas are closest to me in   the poem. Regarding John Thomas--we have been married for 18 years, married, as   he says: &quot;in the book of sleep.&quot; We live together as poet-semi-hermits   overlooking the Venice Boardwalk and Pacific at about sea gull level. I sent you   that article (&quot;A Woman in Her Room&quot;) written by Flako Henig for the German   Newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; so you can get the picture: &quot;It's like a cave.   I lie here. He there. We are only a meter distance from each other and we read   and write together. We are so together we are the essence of one   person.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Did the   writers, painters, and beached Beats socialize freely with one   another?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> &quot;Socialize freely&quot; is to speak in understatement. Most passionate, most   intimate--as I said--at the source of the poem. Add to that mysticism, drugs,   and a whole lot of sex and death.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> And who   were the literary and artistic mentors that helped develop your spiritual and   poet wavelength?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Spiritual   influences: Saint Therese of Lisieux and Thomas Merton. Spiritual mentor: Taizan   Maezumi, Roshi. I studied and practiced Zen with him for 21 years until his   death in 1995. Early literary influences would be Edgar Allen Poe and Emily   Dickinson. (An odd coupling.) When I was a teenager my mother said she heard Poe   in the rhythms of my poems even before I had read him. So it would be Poe for   the ear and Dickinson for the eye. I often wear black like his raven or white   like she herself did. Later literary influences would Spanish and Asian poetry.   To me the combination of the two equals Irish.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> I'm   wondering about Kenneth Rexroth, maybe, or Alan Watts.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Excuse   me, Mary, but my mind wanders when you mention Kenneth Rexroth. My husband John   Thomas was one of his pallbearers. Rexroth's funeral was in a little Catholic   church in Santa Barbara. The priest who offered the Mass was a latter-day friend   of Rexroth and there was also a group of four or five women dressed in Hindu   robes who sang Indian chants. Rexroth was buried in a cemetery on a bluff above   a nude beach. I don't know why, but every time I hear his name I think of his   gravesite overlooking that nude beach.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Why   hasn't there been another Jack Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg? Or do you think that   there has, but the person (or people) hasn't been recognized?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> I suppose   my answer to your question would be (and you tell me if I am being purely   prejudiced): the Venice West poets. Jack Foley recently asked me the same   question for his KPFA radio program in Berkeley. He pointed out that Anne   Charter's recent thick book on Beat writers has not one mention of a Venice West   poet, although, as he said that: &quot;one would know very well that this is   first-class poetry.&quot; He asked me why this was. I couldn't answer. He answered   the question himself: &quot;I know! The weather's too good. They couldn't be   intelligent.&quot;<br />
      <br />
    <strong>MS:</strong> Back to the LA scene, and southern California.   &quot;Beatness&quot; can be an abstract thing. It's loosely tied with people like Kerouac,   Ginsberg, and Burroughs--but often excludes many other important figures who   were traveling around the country and world, practicing their forms of   avant-garde art.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> That is a   recent development. Perhaps when Beat became popular the media consultants   couldn't picture the American public holding more than three names in mind at a   time.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Beatness   seems to have always been on the move, but there are some spots that get settled   in and become known for being &quot;Beat places&quot;--such as Paris, Tangiers, San   Francisco, New York.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Yes. Beat   is an attitude without a country.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> What was   it, and is it, about Los Angeles and the Venice Beats that's unique?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> We share   a Muse. With the others it was more intellectual, social. With Venice West poets   the Muse penetrates the act of writing the poem.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> On that   idea, how did the Venice Beats mix in with, say, the Berkeley or Bolinas (or any   other locales') poetry scenes? Was there an underlying fabric that everyone felt   stitched to, or did people in Venice and LA (as other places) feel like a   separate patchwork? Or a little of both?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> The   underlying fabric was, is, beatitude.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Like   Joanne Kyger of the SF scene, it seems that you are adored by many   people.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> I do   experience many people loving me but I don't know why. John Thomas says that if   I did they wouldn't anymore.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> I hope   I'm not asking the predictable question by saying: what is it like to be a   &quot;woman Beat&quot;?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> I share   two childhood heroes with Jack Kerouac: Saint Therese and Huckleberry Finn. At   age eight I smoked a corn cob pipe, went barefoot, wore patches on my pants   knees, was always running away, sailing an imaginary raft down the Mississippi   of my mind. I was a strong-armed Huckleberry. So if I went up to a group of boys   to play and they said &quot;No girls allowed&quot; I would say, &quot;If you don't let me play   I am going to beat you up.&quot; After I beat up each one they would let me play. I   did that repeatedly because in the 1940s and 50s boys were always saying: &quot;No   girls allowed.&quot; Many (not all) men of the Beat Generation tried to make it so   that only they could play. That kind--I think I scared them. Did they sense I   could beat them up?</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Not   having been old enough (or having lived in California during the sixties), and   wanting to gear this discussion also to younger people who want to get a picture   and realistic, not mythical feel, of what southern California was like back in   the day, can you give me some vivid examples of moments that you remember   perfectly. Elucidate these moments, and I think it will be liberating, perhaps,   and hopeful.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> This   picture is realistic for younger people. Early summer evening. 1968. Windward   Ave. Smoke-filled room. One ratty couch. Milton Bratton with jazz man blowing   sax. In the back room Jamie C. Jamison and Jana Perkoff (Stuart Perkoff is in   jail at the time--four years for dealing) are turning on. I don't. Never did   much. Jana makes hand motions as if performing some ancient ritual. Someone   walks into the back room and says: &quot;The cops have surrounded the house. They are   at all the windows.&quot; We sit immobile till 4 AM. Cops go away. I had magic in   those days. Cars going a hundred miles an hour would bounce off of me. (John   Thomas says from across the room: &quot;I saw one just now!&quot;)</p>
  <p>4:01 AM. I walk alone down Speedway alley. Four or   five of those criminals I mentioned before were behind me, saying out loud what   they're going to do to me. I begin to walk in a highly repulsive manner and   imagine green goop coming out of my pores. Imaginary snot-green goop fills the   alley. They become repulsed simply by my walking and thinking of snot-green goop   coming out of me and filling the ally. They disperse. I go home to 25 Park   Avenue. Fall asleep. I am awakened by the feeling of someone staring at me   through the window. I arise as a ghost, dressed in white, with my arms stretched   before me. At the window I see Bingo's face. Bingo is a speed freak who sleeps   outside. For some reason she had just wanted to watch me sleep. She slithers   away into the Venice night.</p>
  <p>They are all dead now from drug-related causes   except for Jamie C. Jameson, who is, after four years in Chino Prison for   dealing, spending her life rehabilitating younger people from drugs. Jana   Perkoff died from an overdose. Milton Braton was torched because of a drug deal   (not his) gone awry. He ended his life by pulling the plug on himself--the pain   was so intense. Bingo was murdered, beaten until her head swelled up to the size   of a basketball, by someone enraged and on drugs. I loved them.</p>
  <p>Liberating, hopeful would be: Venice West poet Frank   T. Rios, born a throwaway, becomes a small-time crook, then &quot;hangs up the gun   for the poem.&quot; Heroin addict for forty years. Now clean for thirteen. Like Jamie   he helps in rehabilitating young narcotics addicts--and writes finer poems   drug-free.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Also, if   you can draw parallels of your personal experience in, and knowledge of, poetry,   Venice West, etc., from the early Bohemia of the late 1950s to today, please   do.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> I'll let   Frank Rios draw that parallel of me in the late 50's inside a cloister atop a   mountain overlooking Los Angeles and Venice. Frankie, who went to prison for   Stuart in the late fifties, says: &quot;When I was doing time for Stuart. Philomene   was doing time for all of us.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> The   reason I thought of my last question was because my first glimpse at Venice was   in a movie about the Doors--where Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek were sitting on   the beach talking about the lyrics to Jim's new song &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;--and they   decided to form a band. To me, this was the beautiful epitome of California. Two   young men on an expanse of beach under the sun, creating something great and   spontaneous. I was young when I saw that scene, and dreamed of going 2,000 miles   just to embrace it all. Eventually I did move out here, but really I have not   yet gone to Venice Beach. Can you believe it? My friends say it's not the same   now, has been commercialized too much. I don't want my little fantasy to be   ruined. Do you agree that Venice Beach just isn't the same? Of course, it's   different than it used to be, but are there any treasures left; if so,   what?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Then,   Mary, you will be happy to know that Jim Morrison used to sleep of the roof of   our building, the Ellison. Don't come on a weekend. But come mid-week at sunset.   Yes. Venice is different than it used to be. But yes, there are treasures left.   Some eyes remember that the gulls here used to fly lower. Once, in 1959, a gull   got caught inside the Venice West Café. Tony Scibella just opened his arms and   it flew into them. He walked it to the door and it flew free. And this spring,   when Tony was back from Denver for the ceremony over our poems being engraved in   stone, the gulls flew lower as we walked down the Boardwalk (Tony and Frankie,   John and I)--down to shoulder level, right in front of us. Damn if my sister   Pegarty Long (a phenomenal photographer, never misses a thing) didn't drop her   camera or something--the image being that stunning, I suppose. So it must remain   in the mind only--that image--the gulls weaving in and out of the crowd ahead of   us--almost as if clearing a path as we floated down the boardwalk. So--50s, 60s,   70s, 80s, 90s, 00s--as we always know and yet forget: it's all happening NOW,   and &quot; the Great Illumination shines from our own fingertips.&quot;</p>
  <p>Here is my poem engraved in stone on the wall at the   foot of Westminster Avenue. It is beside a poem by your inspiration, Jim   Morrison.</p>
  <p>         Venice<br />
             
    Holy   Ground<br />
             
    Stained with the blood of poets<br />
             
    City which lies <br />
             
    Beneath the breasts of birds<br />
             
    Guarded by   cats<br />
             
    Behind every corner<br />
             
    The Muse, Angel of   Surprise<br />
             
    Poems out of pavement cracks</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Here's a   strange question, but you are a poet, so maybe this will be fun (and hopefully   not too limiting). Thinking back on the years, what word or phrase would you   describe for each decade (50's thru 90's and the beginning of the 00's) that   you've been in southern California.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> To answer   your strange question I choose words which have the sound of the sea in them.   50's: Intensity. 60's: Ecstasy. 70's: Helpless. 80's: Abyss. 90's: Disney. 00's:   Question.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Now,   forget that we like to divide time into ten-year spans; what word or phrase   would<br />
    you describe it all?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Omnipresence.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> What else   is new in your life?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> I could   mention three films in process: Mary Kerr's video on the Venice West Poets:   &quot;Swinging in the Shadows&quot;. Simon Elliot is producing a theatrical release film   of my autobiographical <em>Memoirs of a Nun on Fire</em> for Channel Four in   London. And I will be acting the leading role as poet/vampire in independent   filmmaker Pegarty Long's surreal horror-fantasy called: &quot;The Irish Vampire Goes   West.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Last I   heard, you were teaching at UCLA Extension Writer's Program. What courses have   you taught recently?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> At UCLA:   &quot;The Writer's Sketchbook&quot; and &quot;Autobiography Into Art.&quot; At Beyond Baroque: &quot;Beat   Writing&quot;.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> You   probably give your students a lot, and I'm curious about your teaching   method.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Here's   the description from the catalogue for my class of Beat Writing at Beyond   Baroque:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;…techniques pioneered by the San Francisco   Renaissance, the New York School, and Venice West including William Burrough's   cut-ups, the wild scribbling of Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg's economy of   breath. &quot;Beat writing&quot; Philomene says, &quot;is a distinctly American literary form   inspired by the rhythms of jazz and the controlled accident of Zen. I will start   you off in this process. I will not promise I can stop   it!&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> I know   that Beyond Baroque is still happening, and the scene is definitely not   dead.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Beyond   Baroque is happening and very much alive. Bursting, actually. Its director, Fred   Dewey, is opening it up further: America, Europe. He has begun publishing a   &quot;Beyond Baroque Books'imprint&quot; as well.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> What's   alive these days?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Too much   of &quot;Looking for love in all the wrong places&quot; as the country-western song   goes.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> I have   read much of your great relationship with John Thomas, and your personal life   often comes through in your poetry. If you care to elaborate on that, all ears   are yours.</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> My great   relationship with John Thomas--I do care to elaborate. This may seem to violate   some fundamental reality, but it's all true. Right now I'm reading <em>1,500   years of Classical Chinese Literature</em> Volume One (an 1,176 page book) and   cannot see anything like it. Nor do I expect to in the next 1,000 years in   Volume Two. Nor do I expect to in the next 2,500 years of Chinese literature--or   any of the world's literature for that matter. And I elaborate further with a   poem I wrote to John: &quot;Reason / is cruel, / nuance, the terrible facts are the   greatest liars. / Memory, you will recall: / not true. The oldest stories / have   been found to have no history, and / what happens in between / logic erases. /   Even the end of the world, / as the beginning - / a false poem - / will leave   only you, my love. / No night, / no moon, / only you.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> Outside   of your personal life, what's going on?</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> The last   time I spoke with Allen Ginsberg he said to me: &quot;Prepare for death.&quot; I am taking   his suggestion.</p>
  <p><strong>MS:</strong> You have   a new two book set of poems that includes <em>Queen Of Bohemia</em> and <em>Cold   Eye<br />
    Burning at 3:00 AM</em>, which came out in May of this year   (2001).</p>
  <p><strong>PL:</strong> Lummox   Press publisher R.D. Armstrong titled the two-book set <em>Queen of Bohemia</em> because in the first poem I was ashamed about having been called &quot;Queen of   Bohemia&quot; and complaining about it--that first Beatitude about being &quot;poor in   spirit.&quot; But no one tacked on &quot;and it will be easy.&quot; Somewhere it does mention   &quot;the pearl of great price.&quot; Anyhow, at that moment I was asking the question you   were asking in regard to the Venice Canals: Does a life in art require the   putrid? Does it? In the end they did have to, or said they had to, kill those   ducks. Said they were diseased. I forget how they killed them. Gunshot or   poison. I hope it was fast.</p>
  <p>When I wrote the first poems (the &quot;Cold Ellison&quot;   poems) I was feeling the great price of picking through life's dustbin,   searching for scraps of the sublime. But the <em>Queen of Bohemia</em> books have   both the picking for and the finding of the sublime. Ah! Sublimity! And I prefer   to see myself picking with back straight, wearing black velvet and long white   gloves.</p>

  <h2><br />
    <a name="Interview2" id="Interview2"></a>PHILOMENE LONG -- INTERVIEW FOR RUTA 66</h2>
  <p><em>By Jordi Pujol Nadal </em></p>
  <p>JORDI: The hippy movement is commonly associated with San Francisco   but Los Angeles also had a vibrant scene in the mid 60S with Venice and its beat   coffeehouses, the Sunset Trip and its seminal rock clubs such as The   Whisky-a-Go-Go and the Troubadour. What was the Venice beat scene about in   comparison to San Francisco? <br />

    PHILOMENE: The San Francisco Beat scene was   more political. The Venice Beat generation were Anarchists. San Francisco was   involved in publishing as well as promoting. The Venice Beats upheld the dream   of salvation through creativity, wrote poems for the act of writing itself, had   no mind for publishing; were determined to stay underground. The Venice West   Beat scene was the subculture beneath the subculture. It was about as deep   underground as one can get - lives of &quot;dedicated poverty&quot; to &quot;dig&quot; (50s hipster   term) to the roots of things. <br />
    <br />
    Venice West Poets: <br />
    <br />
    Stuart Perkoff: <em>To eat the earth in search of vision.</em> <br />
    <br />
    John Thomas: <em>This is the   last frontier, boy: think twice before you start and never say I didn't warn   you.</em> <br />
    <br />
    Philomene Long: <em>We open a door. There is no road. We take   it.</em> <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: What did the Venice Beat poets bring to the Los   Angeles cultural life in general and the rock circles in particular? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Venice Beat poet John Thomas wrote: &quot;The first thing. To do   violence to your myths.&quot; Venice Beat poet Stuart Z. Perkoff wrote on the wall of   my Venice overlooking the Pacific: &quot;All love is Holy. All life is beyond what we   might feebly construct. To sum up--Yes!&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    In the 60s this dismantling   of old myths and love and yes was in the Venice air. You could breathe it -- the   new Bohemia. Jim Morrison breathed in and out some of it. (Actually he used to   sleep on the roof of the building in which I am now speaking—<em><a href="thellison.html">The Ellison</a></em>. His girlfriend Pamela lived here.)   Jim Morrison and Ray Mazurek first spoke about forming &quot;The Doors&quot; on the beach   sands of Venice. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: A lot has been written about the end of the   hippy period. What facts, in your opinion, marked the end of it? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Some facts that ended it: the economy, the exhaustion, the   pain. <br />
    <br />
       
    The economy. The oil crises. People no longer could live on two   days a week of work. They had to go to a <em>real</em> job in the <em>real</em> world and abide by the <em>real</em> world's rules, which often did not allow for   long hair and free speech. Before that-- the movement became commercialized, in   fashion (Certain death for any movement.) <br />
    <br />
       
    The exhaustion. They needed   rest from beating their heads against &quot;The Establishment&quot; and having their heads   beaten by the LAPD for doing it. Many now are hopefully resting in peace after   dying from a drug overdose. (It became an epidemic — all the dying from over   doses.) <br />
    <br />
       
    The pain. Free love may have been natural to some, but not   all. There is a little creature (I forget its name), that has an apparatus in   its tiny penis that will clean out the semen of any other little creature that   has been copulating with his woman before him. If some little creature feels   that intensely about such things, imagine the feelings of some larger   mammals-humans. Free love came at an enormous cost of pain. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI:   What was the impact that drugs had on Los Angeles in the early 70s? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: In the early 70s it seemed the whole of Los Angeles was   stoned. It was a mass realization of the words of a Jim Morrison's song: &quot;Step   on [through] to the other side.&quot; Drugs opened doors to new perceptions. The   impact on Los Angeles? The LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department), at that time,   were a hyper reality- a hallucination of sorts. They had been recruited from the   South of the United States to subdue the counterculture— beat it back   underground. They were very conservative and very overweight. Because of the   later the Hippies called them &quot;The Pigs.&quot; Just for having long hair or the image   of a flower on your car, you could be stopped by a cop. Drugs were the stated   reason. Counterculture was the unstated reason. <br />
    <br />
       
    There were two   America's in the late 60s and early 70s. America was in a revolution; a cultural   Civil War. (Later it was found that President Nixon had actually been making   plans for a real one.) Vietnam and mind altering drugs were the cause. The Hippy   thinking was —if they (&quot;The Establishment&quot;), tell us marijuana is bad, and we   know (at least we thought we knew), it was not, what else were they telling us   was bad that is good? And what were they telling us was good that was bad? <br />
    <br />
       
    One thing that turned out to be good, that we had been told in so   many ways was bad, was sex. Drugs were central on the battlefield of the sexual   revolution. It was &quot;Make love. Not War.&quot; The elementary premise being that if   your hands are busy making love you do not have them idle to create hate. <br />
    <br />
       
    The war, the drugs, all the making love formed a holy or unholy   trinity (depending how you chose to perceive it), of: &quot;Sex, drugs and rock and   roll!&quot; It was not just freeing the mind; it was freeing body. It was infusing   the light of democracy into our flesh. It was &quot;Come on, Baby, light my Fire!&quot; <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: And how this affected (and changed?) the city's art and   musical scenes? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Suddenly, everybody was an artist. That door   opened—nothing could stop it. People painted everything that did not move. They   painted their own bodies. Many perceived themselves as Picassos when stoned, but   the next morning their work looked more like a chicken had been scratching, and   one not named Picasso. The downside: there was a lot of bad art in those days. <br />
    <br />
       
    The effect of drugs on the muscic scene? It was circular. To begin   with — if there is a beginning here — stoned bands played stone songs to stoned   audiences; audiences which then motivated bands to write more stoned songs to   play to even more stoned audiences propelling them to greater stoned heights   encouraging them to become more and more stoned. <br />
    <br />
       
    Some of the songs   alluded to drugs as in a secret code for a secret society. Some more directly.   For there was sober reasoning behind being stoned as well. Bob Dylan sang it:   &quot;Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good.&quot; (And the   counterculture was trying to be so good.) &quot;They'll stone you just like they said   they would.&quot;    (And eventually they said they would by killing students at Kent   State.) &quot;But I would not feel so all alone. Everybody must get stoned!&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    The band, The Grateful Dead, even named themselves after the   condition of this blessed oblivion. My friend, performance artist Laura   Farabough's, husband (a Michael....? Was it?), managed the Troubadour back then,   so I was there a lot for free and have many stories. The downside: I cannot   remember them. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: Anyway, subcultures never die. And some of the   key elements of the hippy philosophy were still much followed in the early 70s:   free sex, communal living, social awareness... <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Yes.   Subcultures never die, they just go underground. And they do not grow old. They   are forever young. It is their nature. Only the outer skin -- when it becomes   fashion, commercialized, institutionalized, does it grow old and die. <br />
    <br />
       
    The Beat generation and the Hippy counterculture were born under the   threat of an atomic bomb. Few thought they would reach adulthood. So the   thinking became- 'who needs to prepare for adulthood when you probably won't   have one — why not just remain a child'. In the early 70s the emphasis was on   free love, not free sex. There is a difference. It was about being naked. <br />
    <br />
       
    Recall the image in the movie &quot;Woodstock&quot; of naked Hippies bathing in   the pond. Imagine naked people today in that same pond. So many naked people   today don't really look naked. When they have their clothes off they still look   like they have something on - many layers of elaboration until they are perfect. <br />
    <br />
       
    Recall the image of a naked Yoko Ono and a naked John Lennon on the   front and back cover of their record album [&quot;Two Virgins&quot;] recorded after they   had spent their first night making love together. In the album Yoko repeats: &quot;We   become naked. We become naked. We become naked.&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    There was the phrase   stated by Timothy Leary: &quot;Tune in, turn on, drop out.&quot; Actually he believed it   was more to 'drop in' to another world; another way of being, but &quot;drop out&quot;   sounded better. It was really both: to drop out of &quot;The Establishment&quot; and drop   in to another way of living free of its rules. Many did this by joining a   commune in search of a society of peace and freedom. Many communes were based on   Eastern mysticism which had been introduced to the West by the Beat generation. <br />
    <br />
       
    In one of those Los Angeles mystical communes, (the Integral Yoga   Institute of Indian Swami Satchidananda), they tried to live this ideal of peace   and freedom. I recall people spending hours gazing into each other's eyes just   loving each other. One day another visiting religious leader arrived with his   six packs of beer and suggestions about sex and the next week most were drunk   with beer, sex, and mysticism. This was the early 70s of innocence and orgies   and an orgiastic innocence. Carole King had been a Yoga teacher there. I'm not   sure, but I believe during this period she wrote, &quot;Will you still love me   tomorrow?&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    The downside of communes: We are a flawed species. Hippies   brought to them the poisons (Buddha's term) of our human nature and when allowed   to be natural and free, humans were not always peaceful nor did they always   allow for another's freedom. <br />
    <br />
       
    In the communes I saw in Los Angeles and   San Francisco, there would be a character who used the situation to invent a   power structure around himself. Every commune had at least one of them. The   ideal formula of a commune was an ideal formula for a Charlie Manson. Bob Dylan:   &quot;Girls in a whirl pool looking for a new fool. Don't follow leaders and watch   the parking meters.&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    The upside of the communes based on Eastern   mysticism is that after the confusion and scandals caused by the mix of Eastern   Patriarchal hierarchy and American individuality and freedom, Buddhism and Yoga   became a silent revolution in our country its influence effecting, among other   things, rock star Madonna, and poet / singer Leonard Cohen. (Leonard Cohen   actually became a Zen monk, practicing in the mountains above Los Angeles for 30   years.) <br />
    <br />
       
    Of the Venice Beat poets, the only Zen Buddhists were myself   and my late husband John Thomas-- a huge, calm, enormous man whom Charles   Bukowski observed &quot;sat in his chair like a Buddha.&quot; &quot;I don't get high, I get   wide,&quot; John would say. <br />
    <br />
       
    Later, many others in the subculture found   they could &quot;catch the vigorous horse of the mind&quot; (Zen saying) -- opening mind,   opening body by simply sitting still without the drugs, drink or debauchery.   Even Bukowski, with all his drinking and womanizing, at the end of his life was   practicing Buddhism. <br />
    <br />
    Leonard Cohen: <br />
    <br />
    <em>For she's touched your   perfect body with her mind.</em> <br />
    <br />
    <br />
       
    Regarding social awareness-- it   was real. It was contagious. A large population of the middle class had come to   identify with the oppressed. And from this identification a motivation to change   America, actually, not so much change — but to take our country back -- return   it to its original ideal of liberty and justice for all, and all being equal   (race, gender, etc.). The streets were filled with the force of it. And the   counter culture managed to make it a fun time with &quot;Happenings&quot; and &quot;Be—ins.&quot; <br />
    <br />
       
    The world will never be the same after the early 70s in America. I   recall thinking at that time: &quot;We are not watching history in the making. We are   making history!&quot; <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: Could you tell me a bit more about that   cultural difference between free love and free sex? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: You would   think I was an authority (or that I thought I was an authority) on free love the   way I am talking. I am not. And although I espoused it during the early 70s...   well, I am fumbling through fragments of memory and from another cultural time. <br />
    <br />
       
    I do know this: in the subculture in the early 70s orgies were the   norm. They might seem a bit abnormal now, in 2006, but back then, well, even the   kitty cats were getting stoned. I must stress that, to me, regarding what I   think to be free love and free sex is a matter of emphasis. It is more often not   one or the other, but an overlapping. And of course there was always the   possibility, while practicing free love, of falling in love, which becomes far   more powerful than any amount of free love or free sex no matter what the   definition. <br />
    <br />
       
    To me free sex would be seeing the other as body parts.   And to look at them... well, to me it looks like cars copulating. Mechanical.   Anonymous flesh. With free love it was both mind and body. There would be a   person there. <br />
    <br />
       
    In the late 60s and early 70s free love connoted   multiple sexual partners separately or simultaneously. The orgies would range   from personal to impersonal. People would get into orgies with their friends and   loved ones, but there were also places where there would be both the known and   the anonymous. <br />
    <br />
       
    I believe (and this is just my observation) that (in   the late 60s, early 70s) it began with more with free love but eventually became   in the late 70s (I do not know precisely when, it was gradual) free sex. That is   my observation from what I see inadvertently on television (inadvertently,   because I try to avoid it). It seems that what began as a culture of free love,   became a culture of free sex. I don't see people there anymore. Just body parts.   I hope it is fine with them. <br />
    <br />
       
    In the end, many of my generation found   that the freest love was the most personal. It was mind, body and heart; a free   love that was not sex one time with multiple partners but many times with   one-most personal, most free, over and over always as if for the first time   opening mind, opening body, opening heart. Just because it may be naïve, doesn't   mean it is not true: <br />
    <br />
       
    John Lennon: &quot;Love is the answer&quot; and &quot;Love is   all you need. Love is all you need. Love is all you need. Love is all you   need...&quot; <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: The key elements of the hippy way of thinking and   living (free sex/love, communal living, social awareness, drugs...), didn't   disappear with the death of the environment and were still followed in the early   70s. <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: The hippy way of living was going strong in Venice into   1974. It began to fade a little from 1974 to 1978. Around 1979 Venice became a   prize for real estate developers. Venetians fought long and hard (still do) to   maintain it as a haven for artists and free spirits, but it has now become (now   being so expensive) a movie star heaven. <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: It looks like this   return to what was the hippy philosophy wasn't that genuine and true. I mean,   some of the people that lived according to these ideas were early yuppies or   richer people. <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: YES. And Venice presently is precisely that. <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: This also seems to be true in the artistic community I'm writing   about, the singer-songwriters and the musical community in Laurel Canyon. They   all took drugs, made orgies, got involved in social activities and dressed like   hippies. <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Yes. Laurel Canyon became a haven for musicians,   artists, actors... And there were drugs and orgies, social activities and they   dressed like hippies. Joni Mitchell was there in early 70s. I believe she left   in mid 70s. <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: But they weren't hippies for sure. What do you think   about this? Can I say that Los Angeles had, in the early 70s, a kind of a   neo-hippy scene? <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: I cannot label them. But ruminating--- they   were more upscale. What happens when the money rolls in? They were definitely   leading the lifestyle... but when the money comes... hmmmm. <br />
    <br />
       
    But I do   not like to fall into a &quot;we&quot; verses &quot;them&quot; thinking. In this case, an if you are   rich you are bad and if poor you are good attitude. Once when I was walking down   the Speedway ally smiling, a man smiled at my smile and said, &quot;Hi.&quot; I thought,   &quot;That man looks like Eric Clapton. But then a lot of people look like Eric   Clapton.&quot; Well, it <em>was</em> Eric Clapton. He had just moved in next door. For   years my view was the Pacific Ocean and his living room. He is a most beautiful   rich singer-song writer person. <br />
    <br />
       
    A label is like a fashion statement.   As any movement evolves, it changes. Sometimes it retains its original spark.   Sometimes it does not. Sometimes it can become its opposite. Sometimes when I   hear Johnny Rotten sing &quot;I am an Antichrist!&quot; I think that is what Christ would   be singing if He returned and started up a rock and roll band. <br />
    <br />
       
    Doing   violence to one's myths includes doing violence to the myths one has created for   others because they will be inevitably corrupted. Christ had said, &quot;For those   who have ears, let them hear.&quot; He knew not everyone, possibly only a few were   going to get it. I would like to add that Love (with a capital &quot;L&quot;) was a one   word motto for hippies. Love for all living things. And there was the &quot;peace   sign.&quot; It was visually identical to the victory sign (to raise and splay the   first two fingers). Only this sign was for peace. Peace for all living things. <br />
    <br />
    Joni Mitchell: <br />
    <br />
    <em>I came upon a child of God<br />
    He was walking   along the road<br />
    And I asked him, where are you going<br />
    And this he told   me<br />
    I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm<br />
    I'm going to join a rock and roll   band<br />
    And I'm going to camp out on the land<br />
    And try to get my soul   free.</em> <br />
    <br />
    <br />
       
    I know this &quot;child of God.&quot; His name is David Hatch.   Even as a grown man he has the look of a newborn. He had been hitchhiking   carrying his guitar, along Scenic Route I, the road to Woodstock. A car pulled   over. He walked up, opened the back door and jumped in. The driver introduced   the passenger as Joni Mitchell. She turned around, put her hands on top of the   back of her seat and placed her chin on top of her fingers. Her gaze was so   intense and penetrating David had to look away. But her demeanor was very   friendly. He had never heard Joni Mitchell's name before so the introduction   meant nothing to him. She asked him where he was going, what he was doing? As   David answered the questions he felt engulfed by her eyes. In the car on the way   to Woodstock her eyes were shinning. Her pupils were the size of quarters from   some strong drug she had taken. <br />
    <br />
       
    He did not know at that time (and   should not have known or else it would not have been there), what she saw in his   face was to become the face of a generation in a song she wrote which you might   say would be an Anthem for the City of Woodstock for those few days. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Here Joni Mitchell's vision: <br />
    <br />
    <em>We are stardust.<br />
    We are   golden.<br />
    And we've got to get ourselves<br />
    back to the garden.</em> <br />
    <br />
    <br />
       
    Myths must be destroyed to make them new again — to get back to   that garden — which is a myth, yes, and at the same time not a myth. It is a   state of being. Naked. Utter freedom. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: It's the last question.   I've started feeling bad for asking you too many things... <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE:   Last question? Then I will ask myself one. &quot;Philomene, do you have anything to   say to the present generation?&quot; <br />
    <br />
    PHILOMENE: Yes. I do have one thing to   say. Actually it is my late husband John Thomas' words, but I join my voice with   his: <br />
    <br />
    John Thomas: <br />
    <br />
    <em>I tell you, don't get hung up on anything,   but stand above, pass on, and be free.</em> <br />
    <br />
    JORDI: I will. </p>
