  <h1>MEMOIRS OF A NUN ON FIRE<br />
    <span class="style1">(Published in "The Outlaw Bible of America Poetry" (Thunders' Mouth Press))</span></h1>
  <p>“You are worldly, Sister Marie Philomene”<br />
    The Mother Superior had said in the parlor<br />
    Bent over me, tall, angular, aristocratic<br />
    Like the silhouette of a praying mantis<br />
    “Even your voice, its inflections—worldly”</p>
  <p>At that I was to kneel on the spot<br />
    Kneel with no excuses<br />
    Blind obedience<br />
    Drop to the floor like a swatted fly</p>
  <p>Eyes lowered, lips closed<br />
    I wiggled. My veil fluttered<br />
    My knees bent a little<br />
    Then locked <br />
    I would not</p>
  <p>Back straight, head erect<br />
    My eyes wide, cool<br />
    And I hope vacant<br />
    I stared into her triangular face <br />
    I turned, left<br />
    Through the dim corridors of <br />
    No time or season</p>
  <p>In my room I reached <br />
    Through the silence, and<br />
    As if from a great height<br />
    Watched my hands <br />
    Take the scissors<br />
    Begin to cut <br />
    Name-tags off my veils<br />
    Stockings, underwear<br />
    Everything</p>
  <p>All over the room<br />
    Threads and scraps <br />
    Of my name<br />
    “Sister Marie Philomene” <br />
    Like tiny white clouds<br />
    Far beneath my feet</p>
  <p>I knew I would leave that night<br />
    Just walk out</p>
  <p>Five years within this cloister<br />
    An enclosure of silence<br />
    Latin. Eyes fixed to the floor<br />
    Black robes, medieval gestures<br />
    In the most secret recesses<br />
    A thousand daily deaths</p>
  <p>At the end of the hall <br />
    The life-size crucifix<br />
    Christ’s bruised knee<br />
    The level of our lips<br />
    A well-kissed knee</p>
  <p>Through these corridors<br />
    We glide <br />
    Through our own ghosts<br />
    Muted light<br />
    Fluid movements<br />
    Everything clean<br />
    Silent and clean</p>
  <p>“I have loved, O Lord,<br />
    The beauty of Thy house.”</p>
  <p>But here things feel dirty<br />
    Like in my dreams<br />
    In the convent I do not dream <br />
    Of the good sisters<br />
    Each night it is a dark man <br />
    Who follows me<br />
    He is tall, thin<br />
    And wears black. All black<br />
    His half smile is repulsive<br />
    He wants to kiss me <br />
    Every night in my dreams</p>
  <p>Sometimes, he removes my veil <br />
    Runs his fingers through my hair<br />
    Once he does kiss me<br />
    I am frightened<br />
    I tell another sister<br />
    She says the dark man is myself</p>
  <p>And then—the night I am seduced<br />
    By God disguised as a fat black fly<br />
    As a bride of God I am told <br />
    To experience the Mystical Union<br />
    I must make my mind empty-<br />
    An erased blackboard<br />
    I contemplate the blackness of space<br />
    The millions of light years <br />
    Between the stars<br />
    I stretch my mind until it is <br />
    No longer fixed anywhere<br />
    I become the Bride of the <br />
    Expansive Black<br />
    I kiss it-- its deep silence</p>
  <p>But it is difficult to <br />
    Contemplate the Immensity<br />
    While enduring a small <br />
    Persistent itch</p>
  <p>Daily I work shoveling <br />
    The convent’s garbage <br />
    Into the incinerator<br />
    The flies and yellow jackets<br />
    Are very friendly<br />
    At times the golden insects <br />
    Cover my black serge habit<br />
    Like a jeweled mantle<br />
    As flies circle my head</p>
  <p>At first I do not know <br />
    A fly has crept  <br />
    Into my ear to rest<br />
    I suppose it has awakened<br />
    Confused, and is trying to escape<br />
    Lost deep within my ear canal<br />
    It buzzes with mounting intensity<br />
    Its buzz is as loud and wide <br />
    As the universe I am contemplating<br />
    Finally, I know it is not God<br />
    But only a fly<br />
    Or is it God disguised as a fly? <br />
    Is it the buzz of God?</p>
  <p>The fly buzzes <br />
    With growing desperation<br />
    As its delirium grows<br />
    So does mine with the <br />
    Frantic buzzing of <br />
    That fly. That Fly?</p>
  <p>When it emerges into my outer ear<br />
    I open the side of my headgear<br />
    And the fly flies out<br />
    At this moment, this very moment<br />
    I have my first orgasm<br />
    I know what it is because<br />
    I have felt the sensation begin once before<br />
    While kissing my high school boyfriend<br />
    While I wiggle on the pew<br />
    I see it at the corner of my eye<br />
    And enormous black fly<br />
    It hangs in mid-air as if <br />
    To look at me for a moment<br />
    It is the most beautiful fly <br />
    I have ever seen</p>
  <p>But what did the nuns see <br />
    As they sat silently behind me<br />
    Everyone motionless <br />
    Except one wiggling nun and<br />
    A hovering fly besides her?<br />
    I will never know<br />
    No one ever mentions it<br />
    No one ever mentions anything personal<br />
    And if they do, what would they say?<br />
    “Excuse me, Sister Marie Philomene,<br />
    But did I see you having an orgasm<br />
    During five o’clock meditation?”</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>Beat. Beaten. Beatific<br />
    I am on my knees before the bed, the crucifix<br />
    This particular night is exceptionally dark<br />
    It is this night I am to understand I am a poet</p>
  <p>Saturday night<br />
    Time to whip myself again<br />
    I wonder is Cardinal McIntyre doing this?<br />
    But I will do it right this time<br />
    Five years within the convent <br />
    And I have not yet done it right<br />
    Each time the hand that holds the chain <br />
    Has exerted its own will</p>
  <p>I say to the night<br />
    “I will tonight<br />
    I will beat myself  until I bleed.”</p>
  <p>My body, mind—one thing<br />
    I raise the chain high up. Higher<br />
    That way it will come down <br />
    With greater force—<br />
    To beat, to beat, to beat.<br />
    To be beaten. Higher. Faster<br />
    Body, mind, chain<br />
    One thing. One will<br />
    To strike repeatedly <br />
    To beat to blood</p>
  <p>It ends<br />
    I run my fingers over <br />
    My bare back<br />
    There is blood<br />
    For the first time– blood<br />
    A small amount. But I did it</p>
  <p>“Beautiful blood,” I say<br />
    I remove my habit<br />
    I run my fingers over the spot<br />
    Yes. It is blood<br />
    Beatific blood. Beatific spot</p>
  <p>Slowly, I turn in awe to see it<br />
    It, indeed, is beautiful<br />
    But it, my beatific spot is <br />
    A mosquito bite!</p>
  <p>I stand in the center of the room<br />
    Let loose a mighty laugh<br />
    “Beatific mosquito! Beatific!”<br />
    I, who have been the Bride of flies<br />
    Have become the Bride of mosquitoes<br />
    “Holy proboscis! Probe of fire!”<br />
    (Didn’t Saint Rose of Lima<br />
    Out among the mosquitoes<br />
    So that they might bite her,<br />
    Say their hum sounded to her<br />
    Like a choir of angels?)</p>
  <p>O Holy Night! <br />
    The mosquitoes are quietly biting<br />
    Little fly. Great night</p>
  <p>If you would have looked <br />
    Into the dark corner<br />
    You would have found <br />
    Philomene naked as if by the night<br />
    A Philomene who no longer <br />
    Hid her heart under crossed arms<br />
    But who excitedly <br />
    Held her breasts in her hands as if<br />
    She was offering them to her beloved</p>
  <p>Hers was a song of…<br />
    No, it was deeper even<br />
    It was a prayer<br />
    As he priest mutters<br />
    From the altar <br />
    Holding up the Host<br />
    Her heart thumping <br />
    In this forgotten corner <br />
    As she prayed</p>
  <p>You would see her dare to <br />
    Look at her own body<br />
    In the stark black night<br />
    Her body—golden, serpentine,<br />
    Glowing cheeks, glistening eyes<br />
    Crimson tongue in this night of <br />
    Black fingers<br />
    Her slick long body rising<br />
    Rising in the blackness slowly<br />
    Very slowly turning<br />
    Turning in the unseeing <br />
    Dreadful hole of night<br />
    The night, its burning lips<br />
    The night of kisses<br />
    She danced. Naked, burning <br />
    Bride of God</p>
  <p>In the Grand Silence <br />
    You could hear Philomene whisper<br />
    “I am a poet.”</p>
  <p>But I will always be a nun<br />
    Always in my dreams <br />
    I am a shabby nun<br />
    There are flies <br />
    Under my habit<br />
    And my robes are in <br />
    Bits and pieces<br />
    I will always have <br />
    An affinity for the extreme<br />
    Even now I prefer the company <br />
    Of a St. Francis of Assisi<br />
    Taking  his clothes  off in public <br />
    Or a  St. Simeon  Stylites<br />
    Who sat for years atop a high column<br />
    Or a St. Joan of Arc<br />
    Who heard voices and <br />
    Dressed in men's clothes</p>
  <p>Even now I prefer to live among<br />
    The poets, saints and mad ones <br />
    Of Venice  West</p>
  <p>I know no other way <br />
    But to strip and leap naked<br />
    Into the Holy Fires</p>
  <p>Burn.  Burn.  Must burn</p>
